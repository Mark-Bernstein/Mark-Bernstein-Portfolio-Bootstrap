# Mark Bernstein's Portfolio
Motivation

This is a responsive website created to host my web development portfolio and showcase myself and my applications to potential employers and clients. This is the second portfolio site that I have made. The first version was not responsive and all the CSS was hardcoded. This version was made by use of Twitter's Bootstrap grid system and used responsive classes to reduce the use of custom CSS. I made this portfolio site as part of an ongoing project with the UCSD web development bootcamp program. 

Portfolio is hosted here: https://mark-bernstein.github.io/
